/**
 * Transport contract. Not a design decision — this is the frozen Papers relay,
 * restated in the terms this page must use.
 *
 * Backpack pages are served with `connect-src 'none'`: there is no fetch, no
 * XHR, no WebSocket and no localhost from here. Every call is a `postMessage` to
 * Papers, which holds the delegate-wave operator credential and performs the
 * authenticated loopback request. The page never sees a URL, a method or a
 * token, and its identity is attached by the Papers preload from the page
 * origin — never sent from this file.
 *
 * The thirteen operations below are the complete surface. If the interface needs a
 * truth these cannot express, that is a specific missing truth to raise as a
 * contract change, not a reason to widen anything here.
